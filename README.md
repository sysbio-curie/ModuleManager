# ModuleManager
Module manager is an application of  Cytoscape v3.x.<br>
Module manager allows creating modular views of large networks, i.e. a more compact network, without loosing any detail of the initial network, the reference network (use "nested network"). Identifier are the names which are used to match nodes between the reference network and the modules (and not SUID as in Cytoscape 3.x). So, selection by names is avalaible.<br>
The basic function are completed by information functions about the link with the reference network and a function to group nodes according to a defined distance matrix.<br>
